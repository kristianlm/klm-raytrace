Simple raytracer

				2007-04-10


This code may be freely distributed
as long as the author's name is cleary
presented on every publication.



Source code for a simple Raytracer
projects should be available in 
VC++ (.NET version) and DevCpp



I want to apologize for the poor structure
of the code and the lack of comments. I hope
some of it may still be interesting and
helpful.
