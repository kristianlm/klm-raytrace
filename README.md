## Simple raytracer


This is an old project that I wrote in parallel 
to taking a 
[linear algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) 
course. It's probably of little
use now, but if anything, the [intersection algorithms](/kristianlm/klm-raytrace/blob/master/vector.cpp) may be worth looking at.
